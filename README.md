# custom-freshbooks-timesheets

A simple ruby command line tool that turns time data from Freshbooks renders a slim template and turns that into a pdf.

Still a work in progress, still has a lot of hardcoded info at the moment. I plan on packaging this up as a gem at some point when I get some free time.
